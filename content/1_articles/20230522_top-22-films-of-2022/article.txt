We're almost halfway through 2023 and I'm still looking back. So how about that Top 2022 List I'd been planning to post **A LOT** sooner. Last year was an extremely fulfilling time in movie going for me. Not just for all the exceptional new releases, but the older films I found along the way as well. So let's rekindle some of last years magic, shall we?

**L'humanite (Dumont ’99)** - It’s a quiet film. Long takes and few words. Amongst these moments sharp juxtapositions. A loud red truck speeding through suburban streets. A bullet train cutting through the rural country side at 300 km per second. Ever had that sensation walking completely alone with your thoughts only to be sidelined by the blare of a truck driving past you. Exploding out of nowhere, breaking your concentration, heartbeat racing. The murder in Bruno Dumont’s L'humanite is such a disruption for Lieutenant Pharaon de Winter. Dumont's film is the polar opposite of most cinema. Most films try to entertain you- put all the effort on themselves to keep the audience distracted. L'humanite is more interested in making the audience an active participant in its questions. Bending the murder mystery format into an investigation of human nature, empathy and language.

**Trafic (Tati ’71)** - Had a near transcendental comic experience watching Jacque Tati's Trafic on a lark late one night. This might be his most entertaining and thoughtfully freewheeling film to date. It's now one of my favorite comedies (and car films) of all time! Why isn’t anyone talking about it?! Gags for days. Some of the smartest setups and payoffs I’ve seen in a long time. You will believe a car can dance.

**Closeup (Kiarostami ’90)** - What starts as the trial of an imposter blossoms into a much larger examination of human nature. To take the imagery at face value you'd think Closeup was smaller than it really is, but its an epic work. Only the grandeur of its filmmaking lies within its concepts, its protagonists' inner worlds and nothing exterior. Yet for all of Abbas Kiarostami's cerebral leanings Closeup remains a supremely empathetic work. And I'm now knees deep in an Iranian cinema rabbit hole as a result.

**Crimes of the Future (Cronenberg ’22)** - Happy to see Cronenberg back in this kind of world again. I felt weird and gross and wanted to leave. It was wonderful. This film is packed with concepts. Art, politics, and human evolution. Coming to terms with our new selves. Long live the new flesh!

**Family Game (Morita ’83)** - I'd been dying to check this out for years and the gods finally granted me a screening at the NYC Lincoln Center. I was so impressed by the depth of Yoshimitsu Morita’s social critique, his eye for visual gags. His ability to deconstruct Japan's Economic Boom and possibly predict its emotional crash. Also, there’s just something about that 80’s Japanese film stock. Lots of rich blacks and earthy tones. Beautiful sunsets. I need to see more of his work.

**Tár (Fields ’22)** - Todd Fields (that piano player in Eyes Wide Shut) returns to filmmaking in epic form after an almost ten year hiatus. This is probably the best screenplay of the year. A vivid ride. It would be understandable to confuse the character of Lydia Tár for a real person. The level of care by Fields to ground Tár in our world is really something. She even has a Wikipedia page (in the film at least). Tár is meant to feel like one of our worlds brightest stars and biggest egos. They even reference Steve Job’s infamous empty mansion full of records photo in one scene. The kind of pop icon you might google search.

**Aftersun (Wells ’22)** - Aftersun is a daughter’s attempt to reckon her memories -both good and bad- fleshing out a portrait of her father. There’s something wrong in the film’s languid imagery, long pauses, and fractured points of view. Foreground noises, while focusing on background content. Children are so adept at reading the air in the room. Everything a parent tries to hide bubbles up on the surface in one way or another at some point. Every child starts out as humanities greatest fan, researcher and physics major. Charlotte Wells ability to delineate all these ideas through visual alone is refreshing to say the least. We're given the chance to play detective just like we did as kids. I’m very excited to see where they go next.

(image: 8-throwdown.jpg)

**Throwdown (To ’04)** - Judo is love. Johnnie To's Throwdown is almost akin to a musical. When emotions get too high the characters break into Nage Waza (throwing techniques). Even the non-action scenes are Judo. There’s a back and forth to most scenarios. A playfulness. A give and take to every interaction that’s so unmistakably Throwdown.

(image: 9-planeta.jpg)

**El Planeta (Ulman ’21)** - Amalia Ulman’s El Planeta is hypnotic and maybe the only film I’ve ever wanted to watch again as soon as it ended (which I did!). It might be the vibrating hum of composer Chicken’s midi synth soundtrack. Or the silvery tone of its B&W cinematography. Then there’s the mother/daughter duo at the heart of it all. Their body language together is so delightful. They are adorable.

(image: 10-petit.jpg)

**Petite Maman (Sciamma ’21)** - Nelly’s mother Marion disappears as the family packs up her own recently deceased mother’s house. Behind this house Nelly finds Marion, only now they’re the same age of eight. She’s building a fort. The same fort she’d told Nelly about growing up. Under the wrong hands this plot could be pure escapism, but here it’s visual poetry. The atmosphere reminds me of a Ghibli film in its use of space and sound. The locations are full of light. Natural, diffused and dreamy. The chirping birds and flapping leaves of the back forest. Sciamma’s work always hits me like a ton of bricks. It’s beautiful to watch, and even better to mull over.

**Bones and All (Guadagnino ’22)** - This is a great horror, earnest romance, and beautiful road trip film all pulped into one. There’s a loose feel to everything, but that’s part of its magic. Your along for the ride. Making things up as you go. Guadaningo’s eye for the Midwest! It’s maybe my favorite view of this region since Fargo. Props to DP Arseni Khachaturan on the lighting here. Colorful, but naturalistic. A range of palette I wish Spielberg still played in.

**Decision to Leave (Park ’22)** - A cheeky play on the meet cute. It only takes a few scenes to see why Park Chan-wook won the director’s prize at Cannes last year. The formalism of it. The film can stand purely on its aesthetic merits. The musicality of the edits, the staging of the camera, characters. Most jokes are entirely in the cut. This is why I come back to see his work. Seeing Park in a theater is like watching an athlete or a conductor perform at the top of their craft. With ‘Decision to Leave’ he’s working at his own insane level, throwing so much at you- teasing you to keep up. It feels like a test. 

(image: 13-fablemans.jpg)

**The Fablemans (Spielberg ’22)** - Art therapy. It’s a story about growing up, that is also a story about making movies, that is also a story about understanding the power and lies of movies. Spielberg is putting his own filmography to task. Recognizing he’s used film as escape, spectacle, catharsis and roadmap to making sense of trauma. I'm starting to enjoy late-stage Spielberg a lot more now and Fablemans is the perfect Rosetta Stone to understanding where this master was coming from all along. 

(image: 14-rrr.jpg)

**RRR (Rajamouli ’22)** - This movie. **Yes.** RRR scratched the itch for action I'd been looking for all year. It's brazen cartoonish atmosphere is iconic. An epic campy propaganda masterpiece. Please watch this with friends and their beers.

(image: 15-drive.jpg)

**Drive My Car (Hamaguchi ’21)** - Hamaguchi's adaptation of Haruki Murakami's short stories manages to feel stilted, wounded and cold, yet  soulful and intimate at the same time. Prepare for a surreal humanist odyssey.

(image: 16-cria.jpg)

**Cria Cuervos (Saura ’76)** - One part coming of age story, one part allegory to the end of the Franco regime, Carlos Saura’s Cria Cuervos (Baby Raven) is packed with meaning. It’s beautifully shot. Choosing to mostly stay in the perspective (and height) of its 11 year old lead (played with unearthly calm by Ana Torrent). Her eyes hold an innocent judgement over everything. If you haven't watched any Post-Franco era films now's a perfect time to start. 

(image: 17-sansho.jpg)

**Sansho the Bailiff (Mizoguchi ’54)** - A film from Japan’s golden age. It’s good to be back. Kenji Mizoguchi's Sansho the Bailiff tests the limits of the word "mercy". The world does everything it can to wear down that word. A family torn apart and shackled into bondage. Time wears down conviction. What then of mercy? It's a daunting story, that takes its time, but everything hard-fought takes patience.

(image: 18-topgun.jpg)

**Top Gun: Maverick (Kosinski ’22)** - I hate how much I enjoyed Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun: Maverick. I avoided it for months. Well, enough people recommended it and I finally saw the dang thing and it’s beautiful. A love letter to old Hollywood and the techniques of one Tony Scott (arguably the better of the two Scotts). A worthy follow up that understands its characters and actually has something to add to the story. This is a movie movie. Shot impeccably. Edited to the millisecond. Maverick is a dying breed.

(image: banshees.jpg)

**Banshees of Inisherin (McDonagh ’22)** - Martin McDonagh has crafted a pitch perfect dark fable that manages to keep the conversation going long after the credits have rolled. It's also damn funny. Maybe my favorite Colin Farrell performance thanks to some exemplary eyebrow shrugging. Banshees has also led me back through McDonagh's filmography. In Bruges actually works for me now and his short film debut (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_xMyx_SogA text: Six Shooter is worth a look). 

(image: oldjoy.jpg)

**Old Joy (Reichardt ’06)** - Old Joy’s dialogue is comfortable. I’ve had these same awkward rambling conversations with my own friends. Yet, weaved underneath these average discussions are much bigger ideas. You know where the two friends in Old Joy used to be and where they are now. The body language between them speaks just as much as the dialogue. As does the location. I must get back to the woods of Oregon. Escaping from the city for peace of mind, to connect, but also a chance for these men to size up themselves and each other. This is a great American feature.

(image: baxter-21.jpg)

**Baxter (Boivin ’89)** - This 1989 oddity is worth tracking down and it’s still on Netflix DVD! The story is narrated by its eponymously named doggy in a gruff French accent. His inner thoughts pepper the often mundane moments of his suburban life with a hilariously dark perspective. Every owner that makes Baxter’s way is in for more than they bargained. Things get weird(er).

(image: warped.jpg)

**Warped Forest (’11)** - 11 years in the waiting, Shunichiro Miki's follow up to his collaborative omnibus 'Funky Forest: First Contact' finally makes it to western shores thanks to the fine folks at Error444 and Third Window films. It's well worth the wait. The idiosyncrasies of Miki's world building feels even more surrealistically coherent than they did in Funky Forest. I need more!

**Honorable Mentions:** Mad God, Walker, Bones, Blue Collar, Armageddon Time, Touki Bouki, Eo, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Worst Person in the World, California Split, Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, Christine, Vagabond, Turning Red, We’re All Going to the Worlds Faire

**Best of the Camp:** The Cat, Tiffany and the Trex, Uninvited, Ice Road, Eight Immortals, Deep Water, Elvis
