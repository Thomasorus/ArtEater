I just realized that Shiina Ringo (椎名林檎) inspired not one, but at least TWO different Guilty Gear characters!

If you're not familiar, Shiina Ringo is one hell of a musician. She's not just a killer singer, she can also shred the guitar and writes her own material and it's GREAT. So good that many fools questioned if a beautiful woman could really do ALL that.

She's also great live! (Many artists are in fact, not very good live!)

Shiina Ringo also inspired Haruko from FLCL... which means she may have indirectly inspired ABA from Guilty Gear, bringing her grand total up to 3 characters!

It's not difficult to see how Shiina Ringo has inspired so many different characters as she's basically a living manga character herself

Hell of a musician!

Here is Shiina Ringo doing the cutest duet on earth with her older brother Junpei Shiina who is also a hell of a singer! If all you know of Japanese music is J-pop then you've probably never heard a Japanese dude with a rich deep bluesey voice like this!

Back to the FLCL connection, it's much more than that one nurse outfit. Haruko's whole vibe (even her voice!) is very much inspired by Shiina Ringo, who was the super eccentric queen of Japanese rock by 2003 when FLCL came out.

Apparently in the first DVD release of FLCL the liner notes say that Shiina Ringo was the inspiration for Haruko. I can't confirm this myself, but that's what this website says in Japanese.

By the time FLCL came out in 2003, Shiina Ringo had already completed 3 best selling albums (totaling over 4 million in domestic sales)
