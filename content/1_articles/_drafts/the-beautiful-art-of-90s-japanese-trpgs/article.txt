Quick! When I say "Japanese fantasy RPGs" what pops up in your head? Tons of videogames right? And maybe some anime and manga too. But did you know that Japan also has a vibrant Tabletop RPG culture? One that went on to influence videogames? I won't be taking a deep dive into the history of Japanese TRPGs here, but I would like to show you some beautiful art from the scene in the 90s. I absolutely adore this stuff!!

Let's goooooo!

Exhibit A.
ドラゴンアトラス―ルーンクエスト’90sワールドガイド (Dragon Atlus - Rune Quest - 90s World Guide)

This is actually a Japanese version of an American RPG called RuneQuest that's been around since 1978!

Exhibit B.
The Sword World RPG (ソード・ワールドRPG) - World Guide - 6th Edition -1995 

Cover art AND lots of interior art by the great Yoshitaka Amano! Sword World RPG was created by Ryo Mizuno (水野 良) the author of Record of Lodoss WarCrossed swordsDragon

This book also features some amazing art by another luminary of Japanese fantasy illustration, Takuhito Kusanagi (草彅 琢仁) who was the character designer of Grandia and much more! (he designed the Monsters in Blue Sub 6!)

Speaking of Takuhito Kusanagi...

Exhibit C.

Right: Japanese version of Apple Lane 
Art by Takuhito Kusanagi (草彅 琢仁)

I kid I kid! Apple Lane was only the second ever scenario pack put out by RuneQuest. It has a fun self published charm to it! Later editions of RuneQuest in America actually had excellent covers! In fact this newer Apple Lane cover is one of my favs!

Greatest glowup of all time?

I wonder if these dudes inspired the "Mad Mallard" from Secret of Mana at all!DuckBombCollision symbol

Alright I gotta call it a night, but real quick here's a tip on how to get the most out of this thread. If you like this art, google the artists! I provided their names in Japanese too so you can find even more cool art from em. Enjoy!
