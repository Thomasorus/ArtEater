On July 20, 2020, on a humble Nintendo Direct dedicated to third party releases, the latest trailer for Shin Megami Tensei V gracefully descended to earth and it is ELECTRIFYING!

You can see the trailer here:

Now let’s dive in!

The trailer opens with the Atlus logo, followed by a slow and steady reveal of the game’s logo. It is confident and classy as hell! No need to tease and toy around with our feelings.

As this is happening, there is no music, but rather a haunting sound effect, that’s like a muscular engine made out of the string section of a symphony slowly revving up with increasing static distortion that then dissipates into an echo. It conveys the sense of traversing a vast empty space and also the feeling that something is about to fall apart. If you look closely at the logo, you’ll see little particles rising around it, heightening the sense of air flowing through this cavernous space.

Bit of a crazy tangent, but I got a very strong Radiohead vibe from that sound effect. It made me think of the interlude that occurs after the first track of their 2009 “Scotch Mist” session. I don’t think this is a reference or anything, they just share a similar aesthetic.

Alright! Moving on!

The trailer quickly cuts to a shot of the sky blanketed with countless angels, hovering in neat diamond shaped formations. The cut is punctuated by the thunderous strike of a taiko drum, an instrument that was used in feudal Japan to inspire soldiers and issue orders during times of war. And war is exactly what is about to take place.

We see there are also legions of devils floating in the sky. It’s not quite clear if they’re on the same side as the angels, or if there’s about to be a huge face off. A booming celestial voice emphatically declares:

THE GOD YOU WORSHIP IS DEAD

This is the voice of Lucifer, the fallen angel who lead a failed rebellion against the Abrahamic God. He is a recurring character in the Megami Tensei series and takes many forms. He is positioned in front of Tokyo Tower, the second tallest artificial structure in Japan, originally built in 1958 is a tourist attraction and commercial broadcasting tower.

The idea was to circumvent the need for tons of broadcasting towers dotting the city by building one massive tower tall enough to broadcast to the entire Kanto region. **It’s like a modern Tower of Babel!** What a perfect place for such a stunning declaration!
