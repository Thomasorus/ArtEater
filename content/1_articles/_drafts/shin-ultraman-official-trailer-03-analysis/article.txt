*Shin Ultraman* is my most anticipated film of 2022, and it's not just because I have nostalgia for the franchise, or that I'm doubly excited to see a new feature from Gainax luminaries, Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi. It's even simpler than that. I'm absolutely in love with the visual style of the film! It does such a fantastic job reconciling the iconic old school visuals of Ultraman with ultra slick modern production methods, all without losing an ounce of charm of the source material. The film also has a stellar sense of scale. The result is something truly fresh and unique and I can't wait to see the full film!

For the moment all I have to go on is the trailer. So let's dive into it--but first, a quick history lesson!

###What is Ultraman?
Ultraman (ウルトラマン)  is a cornerstone of Japanese superhero media. "Ultraman" is the name of the main character, an alien who merges with a human and protects Earth from invading monsters by growing to gargantuan size and taking them on in hand to hand combat. *Ultraman* is also the title of the show that he stars in, which debuted on Tokyo Broadcasting System on July 17, 1966. The show was a tremendous success and spawned many sequels and spinoffs, collectively called the *Ultra Series*, which continue to this day.

Fun Fact: technically the first show in the *Ultra Series* was *Ultra Q*, which debuted less than a year before *Ultraman*. It was a sci-fi mystery series about paranormal investigators. Think *X-files*, but decades older, set in Japan and with way more monsters!

*Ultraman* was created as a response to the popularity of Daikaiju films like *Godzilla*, but it was not a mere knockoff. *Ultraman* was created by Eiji Subaraya, "the father of Tokusatsu" who was also the co-creator of Godzilla and instrumental in the development of the Kaiju and Tokusatsu genres.

###What is Tokusatsu? 
The term Tokusatsu (特撮) simply means "special effects" and refers to any live action Japanese productions that are heavy on special FX, especially people in fantastical suits. If you're familiar with that term, it probably immediately calls to mind things like Godzilla, Kamen Rider, Super Sentai (aka "Power Rangers" in the West) and of course Ultraman.

This entire genre as we know it was hugely shaped by Eiji Subaraya, who co-created Godzilla and was head of special FX for the original film released in 1954. *Godzilla* was a monstrous success and laid the groundworks for the Tokusatsu (aka "Toku") and Daikaiju (aka "Kaiju") genres as we know them today

Fun Fact: Stanley Kubrick was seriously looking into hiring Subaraya Productions to handle the special effects for 2001: A Space Odyessey! He was a fan of Tokusatsu, and not ironically. He appreciated how well crafted Tsubaraya’s productions were!

###What are Kaiju?
In popular culture, the term Kaiju is internationally accepted to refer to films (and also games/comics etc) that center around gigantic monsters. Ultraman is one of the most notable Kaiju franchises. Godzilla is widely accepted as the first kaiju film, but the term has much older roots. 

The term “kaiju” (怪獣) simply means “strange beast” in Japanese, but the first known use of it can be found in an ancient Chinese text, *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* (山海經) one of the most important historical documents when it comes to Chinese mythology. The book is a compilation of information on mythic locations and fantastical beasts, many which would make their way into Japanese lore and eventually popular culture at large today.

###Let's Talk About The Shin Ultraman Trailer
Alright, now let's dig into this trailer and it's FANTASTIC cinematography!

Rather than go through every shot in order, I'm just going to jump around and talk about the ones that really caught my eye.

This was a show stopper for me. There is A LOT going on here!

Let's start with the obvious. As they gaze skyward, the woman says "that's Ultraman!" indicating his titanic scale without even showing him yet. But that's just the beginning. Look at the camouflage netting in the background. It's draped as if it's following a vanishing point in a 2 point perspective drawing, flowing through the heads of both characters and leading the viewer's eye to the upper righthand corner.
