Over twenty years ago, this beautiful anime/manga style illustration of The Rock materialized out of the crowd during a live WWF event, and fans are still talking about it to this day!

So where did it come from? Why is it so captivating? And who was the mysterious artist behind this iconic work? Keep reading to find out!

(GOOD LORD IT'S A DEEP RABBIT HOLE--you'll see soon enough!)

This sign must have appeared during a WWF Raw event at some point in the year 2000 or earlier. How do we know? Look at the logos. The bottom left still says "WWF" meaning it took place before they were forced to change their name to "WWE" in 2002. And according to the bottom right logo, this aired on the USA Network meaning it took place before WWF: Raw changed networks to TNN in September of 2000.

That context is really important to why this drawing stands out so much, because in the year 2000, anime still wasn't completely mainstream in the US, so it was shocking to see this perfect manga version of The Rock on TV! And so well done too! It's just simply beautiful! It's such a great cartoony representation of The Rock, perfectly capturing his dashing likeness and devil-may-care attitude. And on top of that, it's executed in such an authentically manga-like style. This was exceedingly rare in America in that era!

Just look at the "How To Draw Manga" books from back then! They are so wildly off base! There were only a handful of North American artists whose work could pass as "authentic" manga/anime. So this poster was either the work of a North American with a better grasp of manga aesthetics than every single Amerimanga artist of the 90s and Aughts, or they were a Japanese pro visiting the states!

My guess is the latter, especially when you look at the Kanji lettering. It's drawn really beautifully and expressively. It has the confidence and fidelity of someone stylizing their own native language!

The kanji reads "妙技料理人" which means "virtuoso chef" a reference to The Rock's catchphrase "if you smell what The Rock is cooking"

Of course you don't have to be Japanese to draw or write like that, and yet it's so unlikely that anyone who grew up only in the US could produce that sign during the Clinton administration!

It's interesting to think about because it's obviously not a matter of race or nationality, neither is it just a matter of practice (so many artists tried so hard to have an authentic "anime" style), I think early exposure is key. There are very few GenX North American artists who could draw in an authentic anime/manga style. More Millennials can do it. But it's the lingua franca of Zoomers worldwide. And it comes down to being exposed to certain aesthetics at a young age where they're normalized instead of novel.

In any case, my hunch turned out to be correct, because on April 30th, 2022, YouTuber, @hhhazel, managed to identify the artist, or rather, the doujin circle behind that famous illustration of The Rock while she was browsing a catalog CD from Comicket 57 (which took place in December of 1999)!

Whoever this artist was, they belonged to the Doujin group, 初っ切りプロレス or Shokkiri Pro Wrestling (Romanized as "SYOKKIRI PRO WRES"). 

Now we're getting warmer! 

A quick Google search turns up a few Wrestling themed doujins (self published works) by this group.

Check out this cover in particular! This has got to be the same artist!

Here are some more fun illustrations from this group.

You can purchase some of their works here (WARNING: while their books aren't 18+, the websites they're sold on contain a ton of NSFW 18+ content--browse at your own risk!)

Digging deeper, we see that the works of SYOKKIRI PRO WRES are often credited to a single artist, Something Yoshimatsu (サムシング吉松), who was a member of this group. And to be clear his name is "Samushingsu" Yoshimatsu, as in a phonetic approximation of the English word "Something" into Japanese!

Now here's where things start to get really interesting! "Something" Yoshimatsu's real name is Takahiro Yoshimatsu, and he's a veteran of the Japanese animation industry, with credits on iconic shows such as Trigun, X, Y, Z and more! 

Takahiro Yoshimatsu is notable enough to have his own Wikipedia entry in Japanese, which you can see here.

According to his Wikipedia page, he actually even wrestled professionally as X, a woman wrestler!

And you can follow X on Twitter here!

Now looking through X's Twitter, we find that he WASNT the artist behind that amazing drawing of The Rock. It was actually the work of his friend Shimizu. The two of them are total wrestling fanatics and used to regularly travel together to the US to watch WWF events! 

So who is this "Shimizu"? It turns out it's none other than ANO Shimizu/ANO清水, a legendary illustrator in the world of Japanese games who has been producing beautiful works since the 80s!

ANO Shimizu's credits include A,B,C!
ANO Shimizu's fans include legends like Akiman! 
They even worked on some early porn games!

So there you have it folks. What a deep, fascinating rabbit hole this turned out to be. This random manga style drawing of The Rock that appeared on American television at some time in the late 90s wasn't so random at all. It was the work of ANO Shimizu, a decorated professional video game artist from Japan who was an absolute wrestling fanatic. As luck would have it, the cameras would catch his drawing among the sea of signs and lead us to this journey today. 

What a time to be alive! Isn't it nice that the internet can come together to solve such fascinating mysteries?
