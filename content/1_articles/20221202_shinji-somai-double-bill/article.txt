Hello internet! Richmond has invited me join Art-Eater as a film correspondent. I'll be sharing my thoughts/notes on all the films I hunt down for fun. 

For this inaugural post I'll begin with my notes on the work of Shinji S≈çmai. I only recently discovered his work, but instantly had a deep admiration for his storytelling. The best place to start is right here at 1985's Typhoon Club (Âè∞È¢®„ÇØ„É©„Éñ) and 1993's Moving AKA Ohikkoshi („ÅäÂºïË∂ä„Åó). I love dramas about growing up and these two are right up there at the top. S≈çmai never talks down to his characters and invests time understanding their varied and awkward motivations. These films are also gorgeously shot. It's hard to pick a favorite. 

# Typhoon Club (1985)
The setups in the film are just so great. Darkness is usually intended to imply some sort of nefarious purpose but here the lack of light shows a plea for ownership. Ownership of the kids close knit subculture. Something just for these kids in the shadows. 
No parents allowed! üòù

(God, Just watched one dolly setup that told 5 different stories that each added on top of each other till they all converged. Film brain is happy. Somai at top form)

# Ohikkoshi (1993)
This wedge of a table (pictured below) - you already know there's trouble in this home.

A beautiful contemplation about ‚Äúmoving‚Äù on with your life. The finale is bitter sweet. The girl sees her old life as a parade raft. Vibrant and sparkling but the fireworks soon light the raft ablaze. When it‚Äôs all finally burned away she's able to get on with her life as it really is. It's sad, but so true

I'm in love with Shinji S≈çmai‚Äôs camera work and staging.
