I was puzzled when Criterion published THIS, as opposed to any of To‚Äôs other, better known, works (the Election series, Mad Detective, Drug War). Well. I was a dummy and THIS is a masterpiece.

At first glance Throwdown comes off as an enigma. You‚Äôll have no idea which way the story will go from moment to moment. Even standard genre scenes of romance, comedy and crime are given a surreal twist ‚Ä¶ and all in the name of JUDO. 

Some films speak with words. Throwdown speaks through judo moves. I‚Äôm not over-exaggerating here. It must be seen to be believed. 

Judo is love.

It‚Äôs almost akin to a musical. When emotions get to high the characters break into Nage Waza (throwing techniques). Even the none-action scenes are Judo. There‚Äôs a back and forth to most scenarios. A playfulness. A give and take to every interaction that‚Äôs unmistakable.

Johnnie To is one of the greatest film stylists of our time. Maybe the Tony Scott of Hong Kong by way of Justin Lin (who‚Äôs probably himself a To devotee). And with this film he blends all his best tools - comedy, (b)romance, action, crime and the surreal - thrown down into a judo blender. Served up with love and care for us. Not to mention his stellar cinematography bathing our cast in shades of color, the hazy cones of spotlights and sharp highlights. It‚Äôs surprising such a gorgeous movie can be so damn funny.

Throwdown is a gift. You really have no idea how stupid and beautiful this film is going to get ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè

**Extra:** All this is supposedly a love letter to Kurosawa‚Äôs debut judo action film Sanshiro Sugata. I need to watch that next!
