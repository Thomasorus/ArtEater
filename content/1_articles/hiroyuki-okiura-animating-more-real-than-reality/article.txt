Hiroyuki Okiura (沖浦啓之) is one of the most skillful animators to ever pick up a pencil. His animation is so perfect, so life like that he's often accused of rotoscoping! But those with a good eye for movement can tell that the incredible verisimilitude of his work comes from a masterful grasp of the fundamentals of animation. It doesn't just look real, it looks better than real!

For those not familiar with the term, rotoscoping is an animation technique where you trace over film, frame by frame, to reproduce lifelike movements. The technique was invented by foundational animation pioneer Max Fleischer, who according to official Fleischer Studios records built the first rotoscope machine "in his living room, using car parts and a discarded film projector."

The device projected film footage onto a transparent easel which could be traced over by hand.

Fleischer was granted a patent for the device on October 9, 1917 and used it to incredible effect in his decades of groundbreaking filmmaking.

In modern times, one of the most famous examples of rotoscoped animation is the music video for "Take On Me" (1985) by A-ha, directed by Steve Barron, animated by Michael Patterson and Candace Reckinger.

Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with rotoscoping. It's just a technique and it can yield BEAUTIFUL results when done well. But I bring it up here for 2 reasons.

1.) Throughout my career in animation (and especially when I was in art school), I'd often hear people denounce Japanese animation as being "obviously rotoscoped" whenever something really technically impressive happened on screen.

2.) Hiroyuki Okiura was the animator who most frequently elicited this response. And the irony is, his work isn't rotoscoped. He's just that good! And if you're really paying attention, it's easy to tell it's NOT rotoscoped! More on that in a bit...

But first, let me give you some context on just how amazing Hiroyuki Okiura is!

Hiroyuki Okiura (沖浦啓之), born October 12, 1966 is a bonafide prodigy at animation. In 1982, at the age of 16, with no formal drawing or animation training, he began animating on the Sunrise TV series Fang of the Sun Dougram (太陽の牙ダグラム). This was long before digital technology and the internet made animation more accessible! It was incredibly difficult to be a self taught animator in this era!

By 1984, Hiroyuki Okiura made his debut as an animation director on Star Muskateer Bismark (星銃士ビスマルク) an original series from Studio Pierrot which was released in the west as "Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs"

Today, Hiroyuki Okiura is largely known for his incredibly sensitive and realistic animation of people. And for good reason, they are GORGEOUS.

Hiroyuki Okiura is unquestionably a supreme master of the human form. But did you know he originally made a name for himself as a master mecha animator?

Here's an example of his work from Blue Comet SPT Layzner (蒼き流星SPTレイズナー) which first aired on October 3, 1985.

He was only 17 or 18 when he animated this! He was also the animation director on the show, tasked with making the mechanical animations and FX look top notch.

Hiroyuki Okiura is also an all time great effects animator! For instance, he was the key animator behind the legendary helicopter attack scene in Patlabor 2 (1993)!

This scene would almost certainly be animated via 3D cg today. Detailed mechanical animation is one of the most difficult things anyone can attempt to tackle in traditional animation! It's incredibly rare to find animators who could do it on this level!

Now lets talk about his ridiculously convincing animation of people!

Here's the legendary opening sequence from Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door animated by Hiroyuki Okiura (沖浦啓之) and Tetsuya Nishio (西尾鉄也). This is the epitome of realistic traditional animation that WASNT rotoscoped.

*This is as far as I've gotten so far. Below is mostly a transcription of the Twitter thread. It feels a bit scattered to me now and it ends so abruptly. I'll be expanding on it so it goes more in depth into why Okiura's work actually does look very hand keyed. It actually doesn't look like typical rotoscoped animation!*

There are certain schools of animation who believe that animation should only be used to depict the unreal. Things not possible with film. They might wonder "why even animate this realistically from imagination? What's the point?"

My answer to them is "well I just think it looks really really really really really good."

Moreover, if you pay attention it still "hits different" from live action film or rotoscoped animation! These subtle differences make life more interesting!

As realistic as this is, it still has that beautiful, neat, concise intentionality that is characteristic of the best traditional animation. To me it's a kind of super realism! BETTER than life!

Now, as I mentioned earlier, rotoscoping isn't inherently bad. Many amazing looking anime are heavily reliant on rotoscoping or closely referencing film footage--and that's ok!

Even classic Disney films use the technique!

But there are some notable animated works where the rotoscoping draws too much attention to itself and breaks immersion. Take for instance, Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings. The rotoscoping in this film has an uncanny valley effect, where it's so real that it takes you out of the fiction. Although it's traced from live action, it feels weirdly weightless. This is because it transplants the superficial aspects of live action movement into drawings. But without all the extra details that come from live action, it feels like a shell of itself. It feels like a tracing, something that only captures the surface.

So why doesn't 





Hiroyuki Okiura made his feature film directorial debut with Jin-Roh, an absolute CLASSIC for it's artistry and storytelling. It's one of the last great cel animated films, requiring over 80,000 cels of hand drawn, hand painted animation!

Jin-Roh is a breathtakingly beautiful film. In spite of these action packed gifs I've been posting, it's mostly a very sedate mood piece with a ton of dialog. It was written by Mamoru Oshii and is his third film in the Kerberos Saga (ケルベロス・サーガ). It's a VERY Oshii movie!

Fun fact: Hiroyuki Okiura met his future wife, Sumi Mutoh (武藤 寿美) while directing Jin-Roh. She played one of the central characters Kei Amemiya (who looks a lot like her too!)

Given the plot of Jin-Roh and it's real life production where Mamoru Oshii had hand picked Hiroyuki Okiura to execute the final film in his beloved trilogy, there's an incredible meta, poetic quality to how Hiroyuki Okiura and Sumi Mutoh fell in love during this production!

Another fun fact about Hiroyuki Okiura. His uncle is Kazuteru Okiura, a famed writer, historian, folklorist, activist and Marxist who specialized in bringing attention to groups who have been historically discriminated against in Japan.
