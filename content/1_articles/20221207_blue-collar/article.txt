Paul Schrader’s debut feature. What a stylish entry into film. By this point he’d already made a name for himself as a film critic and screenwriter (Taxi Driver). Who would have known those prose could make for such a stylish cinematic eye.

(link: https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/blue-collar/ text: The opening hits) you with the grungiest electric blues combined with a rhythmic clanging of hammers. A car assembly line in motion. Every so often a worker is frozen in space: for example lighting a but with a blowtorch. The image dissolves under some corrosive mess to rust followed by embossed lettering like they’ve been pressed into the film. The film is on the assembly line too. Wicked. 

And that’s just the OP!

This a socialist film. At least aesthetically. It's a film about people, not just one person, and no one stands above the other. Even as the opening runs we see faces. But a few pop up that happen to be major actors: Richard Pryor, Harvey Keitel and muther-fucking Yaphet Kotto. Yet none of these greats are given more weight than any of the other workers on the line. They're part of the union see and every man is equal. Even the black ones. At least that how it starts. Equality and stability are nice in theory, but maintaining this is tough with squishy human bodies. Bit by bit we see the cracks in the car industry, the squeaky wheels of the Union, and the unpredictable humanity of the workers. The film attempts to keep an even hand covering everyone but soon characters begin to hold more screen time as they demand more from the system as established. A system that’s in great need of remodeling.

Enter our leads. Each finds a reason to want more. And so they rob their own union. A dumb heist, but they’re all dumb out of luck. The Union's been using worker's payments for unknown purposes. The gang think they can jive a deal out of this muck, but only find themselves sinking further into the mess. They’re individuals now. No system to protect them.

From here we watch what the individual can do on his own against a larger force. One tries to fight. One joins the circus. The other dies in what’s one of the most surreal/sad deaths I’ve seen put to celluloid. In the end all three bonds are broken and

the system keeps on.

**Extra:** Blue Collar is worth watching just to see Yaphet Kotto a year before his role on Ridley Scott's Alien, playing almost exactly the same character. It's as if he stepped out of his assembly line gig and onto the Nostromo for a possible pay bump.
