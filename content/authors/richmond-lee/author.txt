Bio: Richmond Chaisiri is a lifelong lover of art in all forms. He spent his Childhood between the US, Thailand and Taiwan, voraciously devouring a steady diet of games comics and movies from all over the world. Richmond is pretty artsy fartsy to the point where heâ€™s participated in live poetry readings and freaky performance art pieces, but really his favorite things in the world are comics, video games and animation (and old Buddhist art). Richmond has worked in various roles in the game industry since 2007. He was recently a lead animator and illustrator at Zynga where he designed the avatar system for Chefville and got to paint food all day. It was awesome. Richmond currently resides in Berkeley where he makes mobile games (and Art-Eater posts) with his brother Andy.
