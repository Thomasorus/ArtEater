Bio: A creative casserole of influences from the pulsating sounds of Street Fighter Alpha 2 arcade cabinets, grindhouse films, Vaporwave, 80-90’s anime, to the Golden Era of Hong Kong Cinema—James Stanley is Storyboard Artist, Illustrator, Character Designer and the creator and artist behind the indie project, Part Time Shuffle. He is also the Art Director for the game, Aerial Raver. When he’s not working on cool projects, James can be found waxing poetic about his passions including how Alpha 2 Guy is the coolest on Twitter at @beefy_kunoichi and Instagram at @stride_driver.
