Text:

Richmond, AJ and Professor Andy gather for a session to dive deep into Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. This is a analysis of the Tears of the Kingdom trailers but we discuss the design philosophy, themes, lore, connection to Breathe of the Wild and more! This discussion was so extensive that we split it into two episodes.
