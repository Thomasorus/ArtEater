The Art Eater crew finds themselves in an unnamed wood on a cold night...

We are joined by an extra spooky-special guest, creator of videos on old games, horror games, indie games - RagnarRox (@RagnarRoxShow).

Sit by the campfire with us while we tell of spooky games and maybe the white stag will appear before us...
