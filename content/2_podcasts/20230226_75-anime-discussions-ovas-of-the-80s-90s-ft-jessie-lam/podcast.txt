Art Eater focuses on games but we cover anime as well -- today we dive head first into 80s and 90s OVAs! To discuss, we are joined by special guest and film and game industry storyboard and concept artist, Jessie Lam (@axl99) currently a Principal Concept Artist at BrassLion and has worked with many huge games, studios and IPs such as Invincible, Gears of War 5, Skybound, The Coalition, Bandai Namco & EA among others. We each talk about our first OVAs, favorites and classic influential examples. From Devil Hunter Yohko, Megazone 23 and Birdy the Mighty to Satoshi Kon, 801 TTS Airbats, Newtype, Cowboy Bebop and even Harmagedon.
