Text: Recently remastered, we discuss Platinum Games' breakout stylish action game, Bayonetta from Hideki Kamiya, the influential director behind Devil May Cry, Okami and Viewtiful Joe. We explore one of the most striking character designs of modern games from empowering feminist themes to the story of the moon goddess and sky-father. Activating Witch Time we go deep discussing psychology, Buddhist and Hindu imagery plus witch-hunts, early Christianity and Zanshin.
