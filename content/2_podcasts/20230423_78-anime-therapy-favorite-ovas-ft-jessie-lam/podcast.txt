Anime discussion are now called Anime Therapy! Today we dive back into OVAs today. To discuss, we are joined again by special guest and film and game industry storyboard and concept artist, Jessie Lam (@axl99) currently a Principal Concept Artist at BrassLion and has worked with many huge games, studios and IPs such as Invincible, Gears of War 5, Skybound, The Coalition, Bandai Namco & EA among others. We each pick a favorite OVA to gush about. From Sol Bianca to to Bubblegum Crisis as well as M.D. Geist and Hellsing, its another fun episode where we enjoy a type of therapy about good animation.
