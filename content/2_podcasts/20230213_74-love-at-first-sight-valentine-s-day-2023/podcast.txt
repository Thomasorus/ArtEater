Title: 74: Love at First Sight ( Valentine's Day 2023)

----

Text:

Its Valentine's Day and The Art Eater Crew thought we would take a slightly more relaxed route and discuss, Love at First Sight in games. Although, we don't just talk about games of course -- Falling in love with fighting games, amazing statues, Batman & Robin for Playstation (that's right), Owlboy, King of Fighters sprites and even Chrono Break - our love that will never be...----- *sigh* -- Ahem. Also, Professor Layton's Hat, Akuma in Tekken, One Piece,  X-Men: COTA and more!

Think about your first love and join us for a relaxing trip to discuss love....at first sight.
