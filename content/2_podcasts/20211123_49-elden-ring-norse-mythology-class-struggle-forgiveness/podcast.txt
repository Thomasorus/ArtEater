Text:

The Art Eater crew talks Elden Ring, we start with deep analysis on Elden Ring trailers then move to Adam's experience with the beta along with extensive tangents where we speculate about Eldin Ring's story and break-down the extensive use of Norse imagery, implications of the lore and references in the game so far referencing its themes of forgiveness and class struggles not to mention some first gameplay impressions!
