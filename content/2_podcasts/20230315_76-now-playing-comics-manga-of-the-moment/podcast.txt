Title: 76: Now Playing - Comics & Manga of the Moment

----

Text:

Art Eater is introducing a chill new episode type - Now Playing. Where we just talk in depth about media we are currently enjoying. For the first of this type of episode, its actually a "Now Reading" but that isn't as catchy. Anyway, join the Art Eater crew as we discuss our current fav comics and manga - We talk Fire Punch, American Gods, The Bomb, Nuns with Guns (many comics), Me & Roboco, Witch Hat Atelier and many many tangents.
